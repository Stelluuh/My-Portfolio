                <h4>From Lego Creations to Cutting-Edge Code: Bridging childhood passions with Software Engineering innovation, empowered by an educational foundation in chemistry.</h4>
                <p>
                    Growing up, I was immersed in a world of Legos, Zoids, Warhammer model kits, and various gadgets. While my siblings enjoyed playing with their toys, I found my passion in building them. I began to appreciate it even more when I started documenting the steps I took to construct each model. The reason for this was to ensure that my brothers could join and enjoy the process with me. While solo accomplishments are valuable, teamwork gave me a unique sense of achievement and reward.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I grew older, I was fortunate to have exceptional teachers who inspired me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and eventually start my career in the Chemical Industry. I worked as a Laboratory Technician, where I used my eye for detail and gained valuable experience in documentation and research, eventually working my way up to becoming a Chemist.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I fed my passion for tinkering and building during my spare time by working on personal projects, such as building my first computer. However, my love for problem-solving eventually led me to transition into Software Engineering, where I continue to thrive and expand my skills.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am passionate about building meaningful solutions. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development and have a knack for getting to the root of the problem. I believe in creating solutions that are creative, robust, and user-friendly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I aim to continue my growth as a Software Developer by working with innovative teams on projects that make a difference in people's lives. Whether building intuitive user interfaces or developing solid back-end systems, I am excited to tackle new challenges and work with others to create something that can make a difference.
